On the eastern coast, we mainly have Tropical Deciduous Moist and Tropical Deciduous dry.These types of forest undergo much evapotranspiration contributing much to the rainfall in the area. The total annual rainfall in the Coastal regions in the year of 2013 is 43964.4 mm. The percentage of forest cover in the Coastal regions in 2013 is 19.67%. The forest cover has slighty increased and so has the rainfall.This could be because of a stronger monsoon. From the correlation coefficient,0.830,for the year of 2013,we concluded that the degree of linear dependence of forest cover and rainfall in the Coastal regions of India is strong. This is similar to the correlation in 2010."
