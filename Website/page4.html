Trees affect our climate, and therefore our weather, in three primary ways: they lower temperatures, reduce energy usage and reduce or remove air pollutants. Each part of the tree contributes to climate control, from leaves to roots.Leaves help turn down the thermostat. They cool the air through a process called evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration is the combination of two simultaneous processes: evaporation and transpiration, both of which release moisture into the air.Shade provided by strategically planted deciduous trees cools buildings during the warm months, allows the sun's warming rays to shine through its branches in the winter and also protects buildings from cold winds. Researchers have found that planting one tree to the west and one to the south of a home can significantly reduce energy consumption. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees remove carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) and release oxygen into our air. Trees store the carbon dioxide, called carbon sequestration, and -- depending on the size of the tree -- can hold between 35 to 800 pounds of carbon dioxide each year.  Normally, trees help cool the planet by absorbing carbon dioxide as part of the photosynthesis process and by evaporating water into the air. In the tropics, water evaporates naturally from trees, increasing cloud cover and keeping temperatures cooler. "

This is mostly because the climate conditions vary depending on elevation and location, even within the Himalayas. And the  the trees have adapted to the cool climate, heavy downpours and intense sunshine. The needle like leaves in coniferour trees found there dont allow much water to be transpired through them, Hence theres not much cooling effect experienced. http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1436&context=agronomyfacpub" ;

However, above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft), temperate-forest trees such as oaks, conifers, and rhododendrons predominate. The Correlation coefficient here is negative and really significant - 0.93. This implies where Forests are more in percentage temperatures are less. With some planning, urban trees can help minimize the heat island effect that saddles many cities.Heat islands are cities that are often several degrees warmer than the suburbs because the urban areas generate and trap heat. When trees grow throughout urban areas, both surface and air temperatures are reduced. Trees evaporatranspire water causing a cooling effect to occur. ";

A negative correlation coefficient  means cooler climates is linked to increase in growth of forest.The broadleaf forests are capable of transpiring more water and hence cause a cooling effect to occur. Trees also act as carbon reservoirs, felling them would release a lot of carbondioxide which is a heat trapping gas."

A reason for why this number is positive could be that in Northern Plains Smog occurs. Photochemical smog is smog caused when sunlight and chemical compounds such as car exhaust combine. Trees contribute to this when they release organic gases.Additionally, planting trees as a solution to global warming -- a practice commonly linked to carbon offsets -- may have a positive impact on global temperature control only when planted in the tropics, a thin geographical belt around the equator.."

The Chota Nagpur Plateau is located in eastern India and is one of the central highlands in India, covering much of the Indian state Jharkhand and adjacent parts of Orissa, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Vegetation in the Malwa Plateau is tropical dry forest, with scattered teak (Tectona grandis) forests. The other main trees are Butea, Bombax, Anogeissus, Acacia, Buchanania and Boswellia.

The chota nagpur plateau is covered with a variety tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests of which Sal forest is predominant.The correlation coefficient is -0.409 which is significant. And it explains that increase in forest cover reduces temperature. The trees cool the air through a process called evapotranspiration.

The changing colors of tree leaves is one of the most notable features of deciduous forests, as when the temperatures start to cool in the fall, the trees will basically suck the chlorophyll out of their leaves to store for use during the colder and darker winter months. Milder winters will typically promote a larger diversity among tree species. A reason for why this number is faintly positive could be that forests trap heat because their dense, dark canopies absorb sunlight. "

The Western Coastal Plains is a thin strip of coastal plain 50 kilometres in width between the west coast of India and the Western Ghats hills, which starts near the south of river Tapi.
